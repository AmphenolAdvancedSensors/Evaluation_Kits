# Evaluation_Kits
Code used in our Temperature & Pressure Sensor Evaluation Kit

This incluse NPA-201 barometric pressure sensor, ports for Thermisotrs, NPA pressure sensor range, MiCS-VZ89TE VOC sensor, and a 0.96" OLED screen

Hardware is Arduino Uno compaitble with Amphenol Advanced Sensors Schield

Code checks for sensors and displays only those values. A Firmware 'switch' is available to change the output to a serial output for data logging.
