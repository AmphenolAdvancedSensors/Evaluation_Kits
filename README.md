# Evaluation_Kits
Code used in our Air Quality Sensor Evaluation Kit

This includes an SM-PWM-01C dust sensor, T6713 CO2 sensor, T9602 Humidity & Temperature Sensor, and with a 0.96" OLED screen

Hardware is Arduino Uno compatable with Amphenol Advanced Sensors Screen

Code checks for sensors (except dust sensor) and displays only those values. A Firmware 'switch' is available to change the output to a serial output for data logging.
